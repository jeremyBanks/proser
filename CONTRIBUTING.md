This project will not, at the moment, accept PRs. 

We're open for obvious bug reports, and for suggestions wrt perf improvements; please open a ticket on GitHub. 

I don't really have time or patience for suggestions for things to be changed without measurable improvement -- if you
don't like the coding style, want a different API (e.g. based on Bytes/BytesMut), etc., feel free to fork and go your
own way.
