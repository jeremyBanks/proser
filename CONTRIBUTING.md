This project is open to obvious bug fixes and perf improvements. Please contact before just sending a PR.

It is also open to suggestions for great improvements, but please be prepared for rejections.

I don't really have time or patience for suggestions for things to be changed without measurable improvement -- if you
don't like the coding style, want a different API (e.g. based on Bytes/BytesMut), etc., feel free to fork and go your
own way.
